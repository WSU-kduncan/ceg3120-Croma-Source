Setup
- I had to install python3.8 and upgrade pip
- I had to install discord.py and dotenv library
- In the discord developer bot you can grab the token from the Bot tab
- you put the token the root of the bot folder in a .env file


Usage
- I can type in "Destiny" and it will pull from a list of quotes from Destiny 1 and Destiny 2

Research
- Some of the changes would be to run a script that activates the discord bot when you boot up the pc, this eliminates the need for Bob to even remember to run the bot everytime he turns on his computer since it would automatically start on boot
- Another would be to put the bot on a seperate machine that would be on constantly since that would eliminate the off cycle of the bot entirely
- Lastly would be to run it in the cloud for easy remote access and the same benefits as the seperate machine, with the downside being a fee so there's a higher cost to a cloud service bot.
